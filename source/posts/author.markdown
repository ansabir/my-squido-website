Hi all I am database developer based in Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. Right now I am learning about SQL, MySQL, DBMS, FullStack Development. 

I like to learn and explore new things.

I had done my graduation from Rajiv Gandhi college of Arts, Commerce and Science in April 2019.

After that I got the job as a Service Engineer at One Click Service. There I have been work for 2 years. It was an wonderful experience,  as I learnt about the computer hardware and lot of different things related to Refurbished Computer Market.

Right now my focus is to get the job in IT company as a Database Developer.
